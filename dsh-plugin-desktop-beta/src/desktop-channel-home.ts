/**
 * Per-channel DSH home resolution.
 *
 * Stable and Beta historically shared `~/.dsh`. Sharing one home also shares
 * `profiles/node_modules`, the installation-wide module index that each core
 * generation rewrites on startup, so a Profile scan that runs between two
 * rewrites can read a half-healed index and report installed plugins as
 * missing. Each channel therefore owns a home directory name.
 *
 * Existing installations are never moved implicitly: when this channel's own
 * home does not exist yet and the shared home is already a usable DSH home,
 * the shared home stays in use and the caller reports the overlap instead.
